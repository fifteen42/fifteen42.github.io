      <description>The two books I loved the most during my elementary school years were the Young Adult Encyclopedia and Robinson Crusoe. Reflecting now, these two books may have shaped my way of thinking and even my life&amp;rsquo;s journey. If I had to mention one strength of mine, it&amp;rsquo;s that I&amp;rsquo;m always curious. That&amp;rsquo;s the fundamental reason I chose to become an independent creator.
There are several terms related to independent creators: Indie Hacker, Solopreneur, Super Individual, One-Person Company, and more.</description>
